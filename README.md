# DoLess  
**Why work harder when you can DoLess?**  

## What is DoLess?  
DoLess is a Python package that’s your one-stop shop for laziness done right. It’s built for developers who don’t want to wrestle with repetitive workflows, clunky threading, or verbose browser automation.  
With DoLess, you get shortcuts for common tasks — like handling files, automating websites, and managing threads — without breaking a sweat.  

---

## Features  
Here’s why you’ll love DoLess:  

1. **Thread Management**:  
   - Execute tasks in parallel with no-fuss threading.  
   - Includes an animated load buffer so you look productive (even when you're not).  

2. **Browser Automation** (Selenium-powered):  
   - Headless browsing, form filling, and button clicking made stupidly simple.  
   - Parse links, buttons, and login forms with minimal effort.  

3. **File Handling**:  
   - Check file existence, create files, append content, and overwrite like a boss.  

4. **Console Tricks**:  
   - Clear your console, print centered text, or enumerate lists with style.

## Installation  
You can install DoLess directly from GitHub using pip:  

```bash

```  

This command installs DoLess directly from the repository, so you get the latest version straight from the source.

## Quickstart Guide  

### 1. Master Multithreading  

Tired of managing threads manually? Let DoLess handle it:  

```python
from DoLess.threads import SubmitTasktoThreadWITHLoadBuffer

def my_task():  
    print("Doing some important stuff...")

SubmitTasktoThreadWITHLoadBuffer(my_task)
```  

Efficient threading with built-in buffering. Watch the magic happen!

### 2. Browser Automation  

Automate your browser like a pro:  

```python
from DoLess.web import StartBrowser, GoToUrl, ParseforLinks

StartBrowser()  
GoToUrl("https://example.com")  
http_links, https_links = ParseforLinks()  
print("HTTP Links:", http_links)  
print("HTTPS Links:", https_links)
```  

Navigate, scrape, and parse web pages with minimal effort.

### 3. Handle Files  

Stop reinventing the wheel for basic file operations:  

```python
from DoLess.files import CheckFileExistence, CreateFile, AppendtoFile

file_name = "example.txt"

if not CheckFileExistence(file_name):  
    CreateFile(file_name)  

AppendtoFile(file_name, "This is a line of text!")
```  

Files handled in fewer lines than your coffee break.

### 4. Console Wizardry  

Keep your console clean and stylish:  

```python
from DoLess.console import ClearConsole, CenteredPrint

ClearConsole()  
CenteredPrint("Welcome to DoLess!", "*")
```
